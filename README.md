# Game-Generator-
This is a simple Python code that will read in a file of games, and then randomly pull 5 games. Then, you will be able to choose which game you want to play, while only replacing the unplayed games. 

# Purpose

This is to be used for tournaments trying to pull Random games from a list, and then only replacing the unplayed games. Functionality has been added to view the list, save the modified list after each round, as well as adding and removing games at any point. This is a side project for a local tournament that a group and I host. If you have any recommendations, feel free to throw them my way!
